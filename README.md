This project is a simple **stocks trading app** built using the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). The app allows users to perform CRUD operations on a client profile, buy and sell stocks, view their transaction history, add or remove funds from their accounts, and simulate a stock portfolio.
